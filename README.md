Overview The SO-100-YF Gripper is a simple, symmetrical claw-style robotic gripper designed as an alternative to existing solutions. It is inspired by and based on the LeRobot project https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.

**This gripper features:**

Symmetrical claw closure for balanced gripping

Compatibility with ST3215 servo motors

A gear-driven mechanism that eliminates the need for additional fasteners (beyond those supplied with the servo)

The servo mounting plate is directly attached to one claw, and motion is transferred to the second claw via integrated gearing. For improved grip, it's recommended to line the claws with soft or spongy material.

**Features**

‚öôÔ∏è Gear-based symmetrical claw movement

üß© Lightweight and easy to integrate into robotic arms
